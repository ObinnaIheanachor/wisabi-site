    questions: [
      {
        q: 'What makes Wisabi different from other consultancies?',
        a: 'We focus on speed and outcomes. Most consultancies bill by the hour and drag projects out. We deliver production-ready systems in weeks, train your team to run them, and measure success by what changes in your business, not lines of code.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you work with startups or just enterprises?',
        a: 'Both. We\'ve worked with Fortune 500 companies and early-stage startups. What matters is that you\'re serious about using data and AI to drive business outcomes.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Are you remote-friendly?',
        a: 'Yes. We\'re based in Leeds, UK, but work remotely with clients across Europe and beyond. We use Slack, Zoom, and async documentation to stay aligned.'
      }

  {
    category: 'Services & Pricing',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How much do your services cost?',
        a: 'It depends on scope. Projects range from quick 1-2 week audits to multi-month platform builds. We tailor pricing to your needs and budget. Book a consultation for a custom quote.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you offer ongoing support after delivery?',
        a: 'Yes. We offer flexible support packages; from ad-hoc consulting to retainer arrangements. Many clients start with a project, then keep us on retainer for ongoing optimization and new features.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Can we start small and scale up?',
        a: 'Absolutely. Many clients start with a 1-2 week discovery or POC, then expand to full platform builds once they see results.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Process & Timeline',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How fast can you start?',
        a: 'Usually within 1-2 weeks of signing a contract. We keep a flexible pipeline so we can move quickly for the right projects.'
      },
      {
        q: 'What\'s your typical project timeline?',
        a: 'It varies by service. Data platforms: 4-12 weeks. Automation: 2-6 weeks. AI products: 4-10 weeks. Training: 6-12 weeks. We prioritize shipping working systems fast.'
      },
      {
        q: 'How involved do we need to be?',
        a: 'We need access to stakeholders for weekly demos and decision-making. Beyond that, you can be as hands-on or hands-off as you prefer.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Technology',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'What tech stack do you use?',
        a: 'We specialize in modern, cloud-native tools: Snowflake, BigQuery, dbt, Airflow, Dagster, AWS, GCP, GPT-4, Claude, and more. We choose based on your needs, not vendor relationships.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Can you work with our existing tools?',
        a: 'Yes. We integrate with whatever you\'re already using. If a migration makes sense, we\'ll recommend it—but we don\'t force change for change\'s sake.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you provide training on the tools you build?',
        a: 'Always. Every project includes documentation and knowledge transfer. We also offer dedicated training programs if your team needs deeper upskilling.'
